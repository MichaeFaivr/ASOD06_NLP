## Objectives

First, the goal is to optimize the time to preprocessing text data with Spacy.
Second, classify french tweets between negative and positive tweets. 

## Guidelines

ðŸš° The preprocessing of texts can be time-consuming and costly for your computer, especially if your dataset is large. Spacy has developed a [feature](https://spacy.io/usage/processing-pipelines) to implement a text pre-processing pipeline to optimise the process.

To measure the time of preprocessing we will use tqdm package to display a progress bar.

## Dataset

ðŸ“¥ In this exercise we will use a dataset of 1.5 million French tweets and their sentiment (negative and positive) from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/hbaflast/french-twitter-sentiment-analysis

To avoid any Github issue, don't forget to store the dataset in your local `data` folder.
